      This was an interactive puzzle where the team entered an online
      chat room and eventually discovered that each participant's
      statements were being altered before being shown to other
      chatters.  A chatbot periodically posed questions; players had
      to figure out who should answer and what they should say so that
      the <i>altered</i> statement answered the question.
